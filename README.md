Modular

Modular is a C++ project designed to streamline the process of downloading and managing mods for various games. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that can fetch mod information from different sources (e.g., NexusMods, GameBanana), organizes downloaded files, and offers features like directory merging and renaming.
Features

    Multiple Mod Repositories
    Currently supports sources like NexusMods and GameBanana.

    Directory Merging
    Automatically merges directory structures of mods into a common folder.

    Renaming Support
    Includes functionality to rename mods or files based on metadata fetched from APIs.

    Cross-Platform Build
    Uses CMake to build on Linux and soon to cross compile for Windows.

Project Structure:

```Modular/
├── CMakeLists.txt        # CMake configuration
├── include/
│   ├── NexusMods.h
│   ├── GameBanana.h
│   └── Rename.h
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp          # Main entry point and menu system
│   ├── NexusMods.cpp     # NexusMods-specific functionality
│   ├── GameBanana.cpp    # GameBanana-specific functionality
│   └── Rename.cpp        # Renaming and directory merge logic
└── build/                # Build files generated by CMake (created after build)
```

Dependencies

*   **C++17 Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang).
*   **CMake**: Version 3.16 or later.
*   **CURL**: The library for making HTTP requests (`libcurl-dev` or similar).
*   **Python 3**: Required for the backup NexusMods scraper.
*   **Selenium for Python**: The Python scraper requires the `selenium` library (`pip install selenium`).

The `nlohmann/json` dependency is now handled automatically by CMake.

Building

These instructions assume a Linux environment with a working C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++) and CMake installed.

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Modular.git
cd Modular

2. Configure the Project with CMake:

    # Create a build directory for an out-of-source build
    cmake -S . -B build

    CMake will download `nlohmann/json` and configure the project.

3. Build the Project:

    cmake --build build

    This produces the `Modular` executable inside the `build` directory.

Cross-Compiling for Windows

If you’re on Linux and want to build a Windows executable:

    Make sure you have MinGW-w64 installed (e.g., x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++).
    Edit CMakeLists.txt to enable cross-compiling.
    Run:
    
    cmake -S . -B build-windows -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/your/toolchain-file.cmake
    cmake --build build-windows

Usage

Run the executable from the build directory:

    ./build/Modular


    Menu Interface
        The application will present a simple menu where you can select different actions:
            Download Mods from NexusMods or GameBanana
            Merge Directories
            Rename mods/files based on metadata
            Exit the application

    Fetching and Merging Mods
        Provide the game domain and mod IDs when prompted to retrieve names via the NexusMods or GameBanana APIs.
        The program will store and merge mod directories into a unified structure to simplify mod management.
